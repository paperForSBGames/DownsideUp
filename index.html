        <h3>2. Paper Overview</h3>
        <p>
            We analyze the inclusion of two affordable complementary methods, namely webcam-based eye-tracking and telemetry, along with data visualization in a playtesting routine.
        </p>

        <p>
            By developing three versions of a hardcore 2D platform game that demands multitasking abilities using different GUR methods, we were able to find that the chosen complementary methods cover a significant amount of gameplay issues.
        </p>

        <p>
            The metrics and eye-tracking data visualization provided insights about multitasking and level design.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of evaluating prototypes with relation to a more enjoyable experience when frustration is a desired gameplay element.

        <h3>3. Game Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Downside Up is a <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/masocore/3015-1165/">hardcore 2D platform game</a> in which players must guide an avatar through two mirrored screens.
        </p>

        <p>
            Objects may appear in only one of those screens, besides existing in both, so players must use their gaze to understand and overcome challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game is composed of three levels, and each level consists of smaller challenges. There are 18 challenges altogether. We expect players to finish the game in 40 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe the game contains mechanics that subvert the usual 2D platform genre design expectations, thus making it enjoyable and an exciting opportunity for research.
        </p>

    <section id="methodologyOverview">
        <h3>4. Methodology Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Our approach intends to evaluate to what extent user research improves the level design of 2D games using <i>Downside Up</i> as a case study.
        </p>

        <p>
            We consider in the context of this research that overall level design quality is directly related to what players perceive as ``fun'', which is the positive emotional response to learning, puzzle-solving and overcoming challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
            We do not rigorously evaluate aspects of the game experience that could be considered fun, such as flow, immersion, and attention. Our work assesses fun through user-reported emotions. To assess it, we applied translated modifications of two questionnaires:
            GEQ (core module and post-game module) and PANAS.
        </p>

        <img src="DataVis/diagram.png"></img>

        <p>
            In Phase 1, there is the development of the first version of <i>Downside Up</i> (v1) based on assumptions about the game's target audience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, in Phase 2, there is the first user test with v1 (Test 1.1), which provided data for a series of level design changes that were applied to v1 to generate a new version (v2). A second test with v1 adopting different methods (Test 1.2) produced a
            new set of design recommendations that, after applied to v1, generate v3.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, in Phase 3, players play either v2 or v3 and fill the GEQ and the PANAS questionnaires (Test 2). The results are then compared to determine which of these versions is the most fun to play.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Results Overview</h3>
        <p>
            We were able to find through the proposed methodology interesting data about <i>Downside Up's</i> design, Games User Research and the intrinsinc limitations of this research.
        </p>

        <p>
            A detailed discussion about these topics is presented in our paper. Results from Phase 2 reveal many usability issues such as spikes positioned in ways that lead to unfair deaths, platforms that require movements hard to perform, section where it is difficult
            to maneuver the avatar and others. Results from Phase 3 reveal insights about fun, frustration and difficulty.

        <h3>6. Conclusion Overview</h3>

        <p>
            We evaluated the use of affordable methods in level design of a 2D platform game and found interesting questions about:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - the hardcore platformer game genre;
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The difficulties of evaluating fun;
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Frustration as a desirable element;
                </li>
                <li>
                    - A novel data visualization;
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    - Investigate how fun and difficulty in 2D hardcore games are related;
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Adding biometric user testing methods;
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    - Compare results from this platform game with games from other genres, such as puzzle games;
                </li>
            </ul>
