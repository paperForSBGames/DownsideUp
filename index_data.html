                    We fragmented each level into smaller challenges, totaling 18 challenges. Participants responded in a 5 item Likert scale how difficult was each challenge, ranging from 1 (``too easy'') to 5 (``too hard''). We compare the results from the Likert scales
                    with the designers' expectations.

                    By syncing timestamps, we can see replays of gameplay sessions and change colors of portions of the screen according to where players were looking at the time. The colored portion represents to which portion a player <b>is looking to</b>.
                    The black one represents the portion a player <b> was not looking to</b>. This visualization, however, is only suitable for specific segments of gameplay. Some full replays might last hours, therefore requiring an unreasonably long
                    time to watch.

                    To better understand overall behavior, we developed a visualization that aggregated for all users every variable relevant for this research:

                <ul>
                    <li>- <b>White path</b>: ideal trajectory for each level</li>
                    <li>- <b>Red paths with a low alpha value</b>: actual paths performed by the participants</li>
                    <li>- <b>Black crosses</b>: location of players' deaths (if a cross appear in the lower screen, for example, a player died in that place while looking down)</li>
                    <li>- <b>Mirrored bar charts</b>: distribution of gaze per challenge</li>
                    <li>- <b>Black solid line in the bars</b>: expected gaze distribution</li>
